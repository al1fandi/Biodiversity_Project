# Biodiversity Data Analysis Project

# Project overview
* The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data observed at various national park sites.
* This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.
* It was found that bird and mammal species are likely to become endangered
* It was also found that Yellowstone National Park has good biodiversity.
* The python modules used were matplotlib, scipy, pandas, and numpy.

# Project Goals
Central question:

**Understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the National Parks.**

Other questions:
* What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
* Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
* Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
* Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?
* How is the distribution of conservation status in birds?
* How is the distribution of conservation status in birds of prey?
* How is the distribution of birds of prey in each national park?

# Data cleaning and understanding
Setelah mengimport modul dan memuat dataset dari dua file csv, kita akan membersihkan data dan memahaminya.
* Replacement of null values to make the data easy to understand.
* Reviewing the data:
    * There are about 5541 species.
    * Species categories consist of Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fish, Vascular Plants, Non-vascular Plants.
    * Species conservation status includes No Intervention, Species of Concern, Endangered, Threatened, and In Recovery.
    * The National Parks that were observed are Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Yosemite National Park, Bryce National Park, and Yellowstone National Park.
