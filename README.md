# Biodiversity Data Analysis Project

# Project overview
* The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data observed at various national park sites.
* This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.
* It was found that bird and mammal species are likely to become endangered
* It was also found that Yellowstone National Park has good biodiversity.
* The libraries used were matplotlib, scipy, pandas, and numpy.

## Project Goals
The main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks. Some questions that are posed:

* What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
* Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
* Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
* Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?
* How is the distribution of conservation status in birds?
* How is the distribution of conservation status in birds of prey?
* How is the distribution of birds of prey in each national park?
